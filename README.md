# 🐢 Turtletype

This is simple typing tutor (inspired by monkeytype 💛) that prints a random selection of 10 words, that you then have to type as fast as possible. When complete, press Enter to get an evaluation with correct words and WPM. The wordlist for this test are just the 30 most used English words, scalability is not yet implemented, because I just did this to keep me warm in C. Might be implemented some time! If you can't wait, please be my guest to create a pr.
